Game concept
Every player is given 10 questions per day. They only a few seconds from reading the question to having to answer it.
If they answer wrong, or run out of time, they will not be allowed to answer the remaining questions. The amount of points
given per question increases per questions. Very little for the first few easy questions, a lot for the last hard ones.
If a player completes all the questions for the day, they are given extra points. At the end of the week, (most likely Friday)
all players points are counted, and shown on a leaderboard. The weeks winners recieve rewards.
